  What
  Working with a process

  Why
  We want to see the exit code

 This program demonstrates how to start an external process, in this case, opening a URL in 
 the text editor xed (default text editor on some Linux systems), using Qt's QProcess. 
 It also retrieves the processâ€™s exit code to check if it executed successfully.
 
 every process managed by QProcess has an exit code.

#include <QCoreApplication>
#include <QDebug>
#include<QProcess>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    QCoreApplication a(argc, argv);

    qInfo() << "Starting...";
    QProcess proc;
    proc.execute("xed",QStringList() << "http://www.voidrealms.com"); // This command runs xed with the argument "http://www.voidrealms.com". The execute() method blocks the current thread until the process completes.
    qInfo() << "Exit code: " << proc.exitCode(); //Logs the exit code of the process. An exit code of 0 indicates success, meaning xed executed without errors.

    return a.exec();
}
