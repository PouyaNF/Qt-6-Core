/*
	QByteArray:
	QByteArray is a Qt class that represents an array of bytes. 
	It is used to handle binary data and strings in a flexible and efficient way. 
	It can store and manipulate both raw binary data and text data (encoded as ASCII, UTF-8, etc.). 
	QByteArray provides many useful functions for operations such as appending, removing, searching, 
	and modifying byte sequences, as well as for converting data between different formats (like hex and base64).

	QByteArrayView:
	is a class in Qt that provides a non-owning, read-only view of a byte array, similar to how std::string_view works
	for strings in C++. It is useful when you need to work with a subset of a QByteArray or other raw byte data without
	copying it. This helps improve performance and memory efficiency, as it avoids unnecessary allocations and duplications.

	QByteArrayView can be used with various sources, like QByteArray, std::string_view, or raw pointers, 
	making it a flexible option for handling byte data in Qt applications. Itâ€™s particularly helpful when 
	you want to pass around byte data to functions without modifying the original array.
