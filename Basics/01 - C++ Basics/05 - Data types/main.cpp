    Data types:  We need to tell C++ what type of thing we are working with

	Problem: assigning a double value (44.90) to an int variable (age). 
	In C++, assigning a floating-point value to an integer variable will truncate (remove) the decimal part,
	leading to age becoming 44 (since 44.90 truncates to 44).
	Explanation: This is not a syntactic error, but it can lead to loss of data or unexpected behavior. 
	Itâ€™s generally best to use the correct type for the data you are working with. 

	Problem: You assign a negative value (-1) to an unsigned int variable (cats). Unsigned integers cannot
	represent negative values. When you assign a negative value to an unsigned integer, it will wrap around
	and produce a large positive number due to underflow.
	Explanation: In your case, -1 will be stored as the maximum value representable by unsigned int
	(often 4294967295 for a 32-bit system). This can lead to confusing results and potential bugs. 
	Use int if you need to handle negative numbers.
