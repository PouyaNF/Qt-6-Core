/*

	This code demonstrates the use of qDeleteAll with QList to manage the memory
	of dynamically allocated Test objects.
	
	qDeleteAll(list) deletes all the objects (pointers) in a container like QList, 
	QVector, or any other Qt container that holds pointers.
	Itâ€™s typically used when you have a container holding dynamically allocated objects
	and you want to clean up the memory by deleting each object in the list.
